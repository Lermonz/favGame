# Slay The Spire
![this aint me](CraftySilent.png)
its cool because the card can synergize in so many silly and insane ways and there's always new builds to try and more overpowered strats to use like this one. ![this was a fun day](SlayingSpires.png)

discovering new strats with each character is extremely rewarding, especially with actually winning being as difficult as it is. You really have to understand the cards an plan way ahead to have a chance, if you don't manage to build a perfect deck that is. Very fun, very inspiring game.
